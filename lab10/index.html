        <h2>ABOUT TTML (Timed Text Markup Language)</h2>
        <p>A web standard called TTML Profiles 1.1 is used for online video captions and subtitles. It regulates the appearance and timing of text on the screen. This makes captions more consistent across various websites and devices.</p>
        <p>It was developed to assist in transforming outdated caption formats into a more modern, tidy system. TTML facilitates the translation of many outdated broadcasting technologies that employed various styles. When videos are transferred from TV to the web, this maintains the accuracy of the subtitles.</p>
        <p>Additionally, TTML may be utilized directly in websites by utilizing the tag to link it to a video. It is adaptable to many media setups because it is compatible with both HTML and SMIL. Because of this, it is a dependable format for online captions and subtitles.</p>
