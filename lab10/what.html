        <p>Timed Text Markup Language, or TTML, is an essential format for making and displaying captions and subtitles for online media. It acts as a uniform method to guarantee that captions and subtitles are precisely timed and uniformly structured across various platforms and devices, including computers, smartphones, and smart TVs. A larger audience, including those who are hard of hearing or watching videos in noisy settings, can have a more accessible and pleasurable viewing experience thanks to content providers' use of TTML. Regardless of the device being used, viewers can successfully follow along with the video content thanks to the format's ability to precisely regulate the text's display and timing. </p>
