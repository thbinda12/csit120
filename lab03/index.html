      <h2>Reflection on Learning HTML</h2>
      <p><em>Published on September 20, 2025 by Binda Thapa</em></p>
      <p>
        In Lab 02, I learned the fundamentals of HTML. I practiced structuring content with headings,
        paragraphs, lists, and links. I also learned how to properly use semantic tags like
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
        to give my webpage meaning and structure.

      <h2>Reflection on Learning CSS</h2>
      <p><em>Published on September 24, 2025 by Binda Thapa</em></p>
      <p>
        In Lab 03, I learned how CSS can change the look and feel of a webpage. By applying styles
        to elements, I was able to control text colors, background colors, and spacing. I also
        practiced using selectors like IDs and classes, which gave me more flexibility in
        designing my webpage.
