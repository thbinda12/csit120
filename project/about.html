  <h1>About Fresh Bakes</h1>

  <p>Fresh Bakes is a small neighborhood bakery that focuses on bringing warm, comforting flavors to the community. 
    We specialize in artisan breads, homemade pastries, seasonal treats, and custom cakes—all made in small batches using fresh, local ingredients.

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Fresh Bakes started with a simple passion for baking and a desire to share that joy with others. 
    What began as a few family recipes quickly grew into a full bakery inspired by creativity and 
    everyday moments. Over the years, we have stayed committed to handmade quality, transparency 
    in our process, and experimenting with new flavors that keep customers curious and coming back.

  <h2>Our Partners</h2>
  <p>
    We are proud to work with local farmers, small dairy suppliers, and community-based ingredient 
    producers who help us maintain freshness and quality in every product. These partnerships allow 
    us to support local businesses while ensuring that every loaf, pastry, and cake reflects the care 
    and values behind Fresh Bakes. Together, we aim to serve the community with food that is honest, 
    delicious, and made with purpose.

  <h2>Lessons Learned (Reflection)</h2>
  <p>This project taught me how to build a complete website with multiple pages that all look consistent. I learned how to use navigation, images, tables, and forms while keeping the layout simple and clean.</p>
  <p>Testing on different devices helped me see why responsiveness matters. The mobile version looked different at first, so I fixed spacing and made the navigation easier to tap.</p>
  <p>Overall, this course helped me understand HTML, CSS, and how to publish a real website online. I feel more confident building basic sites on my own now.</p>
